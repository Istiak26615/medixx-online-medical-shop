       name: "Dental Care", moreDescription:"Dentistry is often also understood to subsume the now largely defunct medical specialty of stomatology (the study of the mouth and its disorders and diseases) for which reason the two terms are used interchangeably in certain regions. For instance, in Australia, stomatology is considered to be a specialty of dentistry. However, some specialties such as oral and maxillofacial surgery (facial reconstruction) may require both medical and dental degrees to accomplish. Dentistry and some branches of medicine in European history were considered to have stemmed from the trade of barber surgeons. However, both fields have evolved since with a heavier emphasis in life sciences, evidence-based research and evidence-based practice.",nameofDoctor:'Dr. Supota  hamid',Designation:'Dentist, MDH'},
